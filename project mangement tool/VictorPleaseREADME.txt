NOTES:
Login form and sign up form are in the SAME WEBPAGE.

Hi Victor. Things you need to do:
1. Change the .html files to .php files.
2. Add session_start() function at the beginning of both PHP pages.
3. Add code to retrieve user input from login form.
4. Add code to retrieve user input from sign up form.
5. Add code to allow the user to logout (user's session is destroyed here)
6. When user has successfully logged in and accessed dashboard, retrieve user's FIRST NAME from database and replace it in the title using PHP.

When you are finished, the system should be able to:
1. Login a user.
2. Register a new user.
3. Logout a user.
